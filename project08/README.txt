To run, just go to command prompt (assuming Windows 7 here), and then execute
	virtualmachine.rb "filepath or file"
	example: virtualmachine.rb /FunctionCalls/SimpleFunction/
	or virtualmachine.rb /FunctionCalls/SimpleFunction
	or virtualmachine.rb test.vm

All of the aforementioned examples work to minimize the chances of breaking my file.
I wrote just a single file. I am new to Ruby so I didn't want to work with multiple files.
